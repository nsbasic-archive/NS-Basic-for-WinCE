# NS-Basic-for-WinCE

Visit the [NS Basic/CE website](https://www.nsbasic.com/ce/).

NS Basic/CE is a complete BASIC toolkit that lets you program on a Windows CE device or on your desktop. It uses Microsoft's standard VBScript engine as its core, combined with extensions to create a complete development and runtime environment. NS Basic/CE provides a full, modern implementation of BASIC, with proper subroutines, variant data types and no line numbers. VBScript is built into the ROM of many Windows CE devices, keeping memory requirements low.

Extensions provide support for file I/O, serial I/O, WINSOCK, financial functions, database I/O and a set of standard screen input and output objects and dialog boxes. Microsoft technologies such as ADO and ActiveX are supported. Applications you create are freely distributable and are write once, run anywhere. Includes a 200 page spiral bound Handbook and lots of sample code.

With NS Basic/CE, you'll have everything you need to create great apps - completely on your HPC. No cables, no desktop toolkits, no synchronization, no downloading - or on your desktop.

Installing
-----------
Use NSBasic_CE to install the IDE and all the device installers.
Use Basic.WinCE.exe to install only the IDE.

1. Install the new IDE. The password is 'BE50368'.

3. Enter your serial number under the Help menu. Use L55-400-93W as a serial number. (For really old versions, using 3000003).

4. Read the ReadMe (on the Start Menu) for instructions on installing to your device.

Developing
----------

You'll need [Embedded Visual Basic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_Visual_Basic). 

This Repo

It's a miracle this even exists.

The experience of resurrecting this software is similar to the odyssey of Mason Mark, [detailed here](https://github.com/masonmark/Dash-Board-for-Newton-OS).

Feel free to look at the code, try to run it and have fun.

Go ahead and open issues - I won't be fixing any of them. 
Seriously, it's 12 years since I've looked at the source. 
I have no idea how to get [Embedded Visual Basic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_Visual_Basic) - you'll need that to compile the device code.

NS BASIC/CE was released in 1998 and was developed until 2009, when it became clear that Microsoft had no more interest in Windows CE.
