Creating new project in eVC 4:

1. WCE MFC AppWizard (exe). Use the defaults, except
- Project Name = Script, select CPU types
- Single form based
- Features - ActiveX control, MFC 2.0 compatible commandBar
Close the project.


2. Copy the files from the current live version into the folder for the new project.
 - all *.h files (overwrite MainFrm.h, resource.h, StdAfx.h, script.h, scriptdoc.h, scriptView.h)
 - all *.cpp files (overwrite StdAfx.h, MainFrm.cpp, Script.cpp, ScriptDoc.cpp, ScripView.cpp)
 - script.odl
 - script_i.c
 - script.rc
 - contents of res folder

3. Open the new project and the live version side by side. In the Project Navigator, open the FileView of each.

4. Source Files:
Add all the *.cpp files to the new project. 5 exist already.
Add script.odl
Add script_i.c
Add script.rc

5. Header Files:
Add the *.h files to the new project. 7 exist already. 

6. Resource Files:
Add the *.bmp and *.ico files. 2 exist already.

7. Change Platform to what you are using, i.e. NETBOOKPRO
In Project Settings, all configs, C/C++, category pch, for all source files, set to Not using PCH
 (was just for file script_i.c)
In Project Settings, each config, Link: set output file name to Basic.exe
In Project Settings, Debug, change Download directory to be "Program Files\ns basic\
