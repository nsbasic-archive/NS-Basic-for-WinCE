Microsoft provided a set of ActiveX controls with its product, eMbedded Visual Basic. These controls work well with NS Basic/CE and are very widely used.

<p>The controls have not been updated in many years. This has not proved to be a problem. They are stable and relatively bug free, and seem to be quite safe to use. Microsoft is no longer maintaining them.

<p>Starting with NS Basic/CE 6.0, NS BASIC has provided its own version of the PictureBox. It includes the same commands, but it is much more powerful and runs on more platforms (including Windows 2000, XP and Vista).  With NS Basic/CE 7.0, replacements are included for the following:

<ul>
	<li>Common Dialog</li>
	<li>File I/O</li>
	<li>File System</li>
	<li>ImageList</li>
	<li>ListView</li>
	<li>Picturebox</li>
	<li>Serial Communications - Serial</li>
	<li>Tcp/IP Communications - Tcp/IP</li>
</ul>
