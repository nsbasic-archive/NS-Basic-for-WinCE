<h3>Purpose </h3>
<p>The purpose of this tutorial is to help learn a few more 
  NS Basic/CE programming techniques. You should complete Tutorial #1 before 
  beginning this tutorial. In this tutorial, the techniques of using multiple 
  forms will be covered. </p>
<h3>Description of the Program </h3>
<p>The program to be developed has two forms. Form #1 allows 
  the user to enter a birthdate and name. Form #2 shows the values of the previously 
  entered birthdate and name plus it tells on what day of the week the birthdate 
  occurred. </p>
<h3>Program Development </h3>
<h4>1. Startup</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Start NS Basic/CE Desktop IDE from the Start menu.</li>

    screen select Standard Project </li>
</ul>
<h4>2. Modify the First Form's Parameters </h4>
<ul>
  <li>You should 
    now see a blank form with the title &quot;Form1&quot; </li>

<p><h4>6. Code to transfer to Form 2 </h4></p>
<p>When the user taps on the &quot;Show the Day of the Week&quot; 
  button, we want Form 2 to appear. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Go back to Form 1 by double clicking on MyForm1 in the Project Explorer.
  <li>Double click on the "Show Day of Week" button to bring up its Code Window.</li>
  <li>Enter these lines of code after the SUB line: </li>
</ul>
<pre>
	MyForm1_Hide
	MyForm2_Show
</pre>
<ul>
  <li>Close the code window. </li>
</ul>
<p>This code hides the objects on Form 1 and displays the objects on Form 2.

<p><h4>7. Provide Code for Form 2 Objects</h4> </p>
<ul>
  <li>Double click on MyForm2 in the Project Explorer to go to Form 2.</li>
</ul>
<p>Supply code to be executed after the form is drawn </p>
<ul>
  <li>Double click any part of the form which doesn't have an object underneath
    to open the code window. </li>
  <li>Enter these 
    lines of code after the SUB MyForm2_2_Load line </li>
</ul>
<pre>
	textName2.text = textName1.text
	textDate2.text = dateBirth3.text
	textDayName.text = WeekDayName(WeekDay(textDate2.text))
</pre>
<ul>
  <li>Close the Code Window. </li>
</ul>
<p>This code fills in form's TextBoxes with values before the 
  device displays the form to the user. </p>
<ul>
  <li>It sets the 
    TextBox on the form that contains the user's name to the value from the textbox on Form 1.</li>
  <li>It sets the 
    TextBox on the form which contains the birthday to the value from date picker on Form 1. This is the value entered on Form 1 by the user using the 
    date popup routine. </li>
  <li>It sets the 
    TextBox on the form that contains the Day-of-week. It does this by using the function
    WeekDay to create a number from 1 to 7, passing the value to the function
    WeekDayName to get the string representation of the day of week, and supplying it as input 
    the birthday in MyDate. </li>
</ul>

<p><h4>8. Supply code for the Go Back button to go back to Form 1</h4></p>
<ul>
  <li>Double click 
    on the button to bring up the Code Window </li>
  <li>Enter this 
    code after the SUB line </li>
</ul>
<pre>
	MyForm2_Hide
	MyForm1_Show
</pre>
<ul>
  <li>Close the 
    Code Window. </li>
</ul>
<p>When this button is selected, the program will just cause 
  Form 1 to re-appear and the user can try another date. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Save the 
    Project </li>
</ul>
<p>Save the project as MyProject.nsb in a directory you like.&nbsp; 
  All form definitions, form objects, all code, and other project info are saved 
  into the one project file. </p>
<p>12. Generate the downloadable device file</p>
<ul>
  <li>Select Start from the Run menu. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any errors, an error message will appear and 
  the code window will appear with the section of code where the error occurred 
  highlighted. Errors must be corrected and Compile repeated until there are no 
  more errors. </p>
<p>The file must be downloaded to the CE device to execute your project. </p>
<p>Congratulations !! You have now written your second NS Basic/CE program. </p>
<h3>Testing The Project </h3>
<ul>
  <li>Make sure your device is connected via ActiveSync</li>
  <li>Click Start from the Run menu.</li>
  <li>After the ActiveSync completes, your program should begin execution.</li>
</ul>
