<P>The double declining balance method computes depreciation at an accelerated rate. Depreciation is highest in the first period and decreases in successive periods.

<P>The DDB function uses the following formula to calculate depreciation for a given period:</P>

</TABLE>

<P>The internal rate of return is the interest rate received for an investment consisting of payments and receipts that occur at regular intervals.</P>
<P>The IRR function uses the order of values within the array to interpret the order of payments and receipts. Be sure to enter your payment and receipt values in the correct sequence. The cash flow for each period does not have to be fixed, as it is for an annuity.</P>
<P>IRR is calculated by iteration. Starting with the value of guess, IRR cycles through the calculation until the result is accurate to within 0.00001 percent. If IRR cannot find a result after 20 tries, it fails.</P>

<P>The modified internal rate of return is the internal rate of return when payments and receipts are financed at different rates. The MIRR function takes into account both the cost of the investment (finance_rate) and the interest rate received on reinvestment of cash (reinvest_rate).</P>
<P>The finance_rate and reinvest_rate arguments are percentages expressed as decimal values. For example, 12 percent is expressed as 0.12.</P>

<P>An annuity is a series of fixed cash payments made over a period of time. An annuity can be a loan (such as a home mortgage) or an investment (such as a monthly savings plan).</P>
<P>The rate and nper arguments must be calculated using payment periods expressed in the same units. For example, if rate is calculated using months, nper must also be calculated using months.</P>
<P>For all arguments, cash paid out (such as deposits to savings) is by negative numbers; cash received (such as dividend checks) is represented by positive numbers.</P>

<P>Nper</TD>
<TD WIDTH="88%" VALIGN="TOP">
<P>Required. Sets total number of payment periods in the annuity. For example, if you make monthly payments on a four year boat loan, your loan has a total of 4 * 12 (or 48) payment periods.</TD>

<P>Pv</TD>
<TD WIDTH="88%" VALIGN="TOP">
<P>Required. Sets present value, or value today, of a series of future payments or receipts. For example, when you borrow money to buy a boat, the loan amount is the present value to the lender of the monthly boat payments you will make.</TD>

<TD WIDTH="88%" VALIGN="TOP">
<P>Optional. Sets future value or cash balance you want after you make the final payment. For example, the future value of a loan is $0 because that is its value after the final payment.

<P>An annuity is a series of fixed cash payments made over a period of time. An annuity can be a loan (such as a home mortgage) or an investment (such as a monthly savings plan).</P>
<P>For all arguments, cash paid out (such as deposits to savings) is represented by negative numbers; cash received (such as dividend checks) is represented by positive numbers.</P>
<P>Rate is calculated by iteration. Starting with the value of guess, the Rate function cycles through the calculation until the result is accurate to within 0.00001 percent. If Rate cannot find a result after 20 tries, it fails. If your guess is 10 percent and Rate fails, try a different value for guess.</P>
