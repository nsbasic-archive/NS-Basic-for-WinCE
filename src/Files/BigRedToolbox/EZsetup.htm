<P>If you are a WinCE author and are looking for an inexpensive way to create / obtain a setup program, look at EZSetup! 

<P>Once you have created your .cab files (as described in the WinCE SDK), you are ready to use EZSetup. EZSetup takes your .cab files and *outputs* a compressed, self-contained, self-extracting Windows setup program that will set up your WinCE software. NS Basic/CE uses this tool for its setup requirements. The result is a single executable that will set up your WinCE app simply by clicking on the download link! You provide EZSetup with a readme.txt file, a eula.txt file (end-user license agreement), and your .ini & .cabs, and it'll output a setup program ready to be used. It is really simple to use. Save yourself the time and effort trying to make your own setup program or purchasing expensive alternatives!

<H4>Installation</H4>

Download the file and install it on your desktop. There is no installer: all you need is the file as downloaded.
<H4>Usage</H4>

<CODE>ezsetup &lt;-i inifilename> &lt;-r readme.txt> &lt;-e eula.txt> &lt;-o outputexe></CODE>

<P>Creates a compressed, self-contained and self-extracting Win32 gui setup application that when run on your desktop PC will install a WinCE application to a WinCE 2.x and above device. To operate, ezsetup simply needs your .ini and .cab files, a readme.txt file and a eula.txt file. 

<P>(For more info on .ini and .cab files, see the WinCE SDK documentation).
