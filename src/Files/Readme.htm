	<li>New Sample: HTMLview
</ol>

<p><B><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=3>
Documentation Changes for Version 8.1.0
</B></FONT>
<OL> 
	<li><p>Hi Res Support: Some Windows Mobile devices have a screen size larger than 240x320. Devices with VGA screens are 480 x 640, for example. NS Basic/CE programs running on devices with different screen sizes have always looked exactly the same: the 240x320 coordinates are mapped on the VGA screen so everything is still in the same place and the screen completely filled. 
	<p>However, it is possible to use the extra pixels. By setting HiRes Aware to True in Project Properties, your program will treat the screen as it actually is 480 x 640. This will let you create smaller objects and smaller text.
	<p>If you want your project to be Hi Res aware, but still run on regular devices, check output.height and output.width in your Form_Load routine. Adjust object bounds and font sizes if necessary.
	
	<li><p>Dir To Install: Lets you specify a directory to be installed with your app. In Project Properties, you can now enter in the name of a folder in the project's directory. This folder (and its contents) will be included in the installer. It will be put into the home directory of your app on the device. This is a handy feature if you have a number of files to be included with your app, such as data, sounds or images: you no longer have to specify the name of each of these files.
	
	<li><p>SendMessageString(): This function works just like SendMessage(), but allows a string as the last argument.
	
	<li><p>Fat Executables: NS Basic/CE now produces a single exe file which contains the NS Basic runtime. While it increases the size of the program by about 200k, it eliminates the installation of \Program Files\nsbasic\Basic.exe, saving the same amount. One less directory is created in \Program Files and many registry entries are eliminated. The net result is a simpler installation. Launch times should also go down.
	
	<li><p>Icons: To replace the default NS Basic icon in your app, create a .ico file and put its name into the Icon property in Project Properties. Which sizes are needed depending on what devices you are supporting. If you want to support all devices, you will need at least the following: 16x16, 21x21, 32x32, 43x43 and 64x64. A good free tool for making .ico files is <a href="http://icofx.ro/" target="_top">IcoFX</a>.

<p><B><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=3>

</B></FONT>
<OL>
	<lI>Gradient buttons: This new style of button gives apps a modern look and feel. The background color of the button transitions smoothly from one color to another, either vertically or horizontally. It is also useful as a background image. Complete details are in the Language Reference. See the "Gradient" sample as well.
	<p><img src="technotes/images/gradientbuttons.bmp">
	<p>At this time, gradient buttons are supported by Windows Mobile 5 and newer devices.
	
	<li><p>Options Installer Screen: This screen controls options for creating the installer. If you have a Windows Mobile device, you probably do not need to change them. There is more information in <a href="http://www.nsbasic.com/ce/info/technotes/TN30.htm" target="_top">Tech Note 30</a>.
	
	<li><p>Starting a program: The options on the Run menu have changed.
	    <p>Start: Saves your work, creates an exe file that can run on the device, then creates an installer for it. If "Run Automatically" is set in Options, the installer is started.
	    <p>Update App on Device: Use this if your app is already installed on the device and you just want to update your program's exe. If "Run Automatically" is set in Options, the app is started.
	    <P>Install Device IDE: The Device IDE is install and its serial number is set. You only need to do this if you want to program on the device.
	
	<li><p>Resources: Resources are files that are associated with your project, to either be installed in the program's folder or embedded directly in your exe file. For more information on files to be installed, see <a href="http://www.nsbasic.com/ce/info/technotes/TN30.htm" target="_top">Tech Note 30</a>. Embedded files are covered next...
		
	<li>Embedding Files: You can now embed files in the main exe file, to be extracted and used and runtime. This results in a number of interesting possibilities:
	<ul>
	<li>	Controls can be extracted, save as files and registered at runtime - simplifying or even eliminating the need for an installer.</li>
	<li>	Bitmaps can saved in the exe and displayed using a PictureBox - no separate file needs to be installed.</li>
	<li>	Sounds can be embedded in the exe and played, again without needing to install a separate file.</li>
	<li>	Store data for your program in the exe for use during runtime.
	</ul>
	To embed a file, add it as a Resource to the project. The GetResource function can be used to extract it, save it or register it.
	<li><p>GetResource(Name[, [filename, register]])

	<p>This powerful function allows you to do a number of things to resources contained in your app. The resources must already exist in your app: they must first be added in the IDE as Resources of type 'File' in the Project Explorer of the IDE.

	<p>Use this function to:
	<ul>
	<li>	Read the contents of a resource into a string in your program.</li>
	<li>	Copy the contents of a resource into a file.</li>
	<li>	Register and unregister controls.</li>
	<li>	Install an ActiveX control and register it.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Complete documentation can be found in the Language Reference. See the "Resources" sample for more info.
	
	<lI><p>CreateShortcut(Shortcut name, target path) 
	<p>Creates a directory shortcut to an executable. Returns true if successful, false if it cannot create the shortcut or it already exists. The target path should include quote marks, so it can be parsed properly. 

	<p>Example:
	<pre>
'This will create a link in the Programs folder to your program.
err = CreateShortcut("\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\My Test.exe", """" & currentPath & """")
	</pre>
	<lI><p>NSCEPictureBox.ResourceBitmapIDstr: This property gives the name of a bitmap (.bmp) resource to be displayed in a picturebox. The .ResourceFile property must also be set with the name of the file (an exe or dll) that contains the bitmap resource. It is similar to the .ResourceBitmapID resource, which only takes a resource number. The name must be in upper case.
	<p>Example:
	<pre>myPicturebox.ResourceBitmapIDstr = "GRADIENTBUTTON"</pre>
	See the "Resources" sample for more info.
	
	<li><p>Support for older versions of Windows CE has been dropped: The installers for NS Basic were getting unncessarily complex: Windows CE devices as far back as 1996 were being supported. NS Basic/CE 8.1 supports devices using Windows CE 4.2 and later. Pocket PC 2003 and all Windows Mobile devices with touchscreens are supported, as well as Windows Mobile Embedded devices.  
	
	<li><p>Compatibility: NS Basic/CE 7 programs (and earlier) should load into NS Basic/CE 8.1 with no problem. NS Basic/CE 8.1 programs will not open in earlier versions, so keep a backup!

	<LI>The minimize button on Windows Mobile doesn't close your app: it just minimizes it. (That's Microsoft's implementation). The old version of your app is still running. You need to close the current app before downloading the new one. The easiest way to do this is to use Settings... System... Memory... Active Programs to kill the currently running one before downloading the new one.

<P>If you add the statement <code>ShowOKButton True</code> at the beginning of your program, the X in the top right will change to an OK button. Tapping that will close your app.

<p>There are also freeware apps, like TaskMgr from <a href="http://www.dotfred.net/TaskMgr.htm" target="_top">http://www.dotfred.net/TaskMgr.htm</a> that make this easier by going on the taskbar.
	<LI>Starting with Windows Mobile 5 devices, OptionButton groups are not working properly on OptionButton objects that are added using the Forms designer. They work properly if added using the AddObject command in your Form_Open code. (We will fix this of course!)

	<LI>INPUTBOX does not size properly on most devices. This command is built into Microsoft's software. You can use the InputBox function that is part of the DialogX control to do the same thing. Putting this in your program will override the faulty InputBox function. (DialogX also provides additional functionality not contained in InputBox.)
	<font size=3><pre>
	DIM NSBIB
	FUNCTION INPUTBOX(prompt, title, default)
	  IF ISEMPTY(NSBIB) THEN
	    ADDOBJECT "DialogX", "NSBIB_Dlg", 0, 0, 0, 0
	    SET NSBIB=NSBIB_Dlg
	  END IF  
	  INPUTBOX = NSBIB.InputBox(prompt, title, default)
	END FUNCTION  'INPUTBOX

	X=InputBox("Message area", "INPUTBOX Example", "Default Text")</pre></font>

	<LI>The EVAL statement doen't work on some devices. This appears to be a problem in Microsoft's compiler. Use the Execute statement instead.
	<LI>Date Object: Do not use a MSGBOX statement inside the Change event: it goes into a click event loop as MSGBOX generates its own events.
