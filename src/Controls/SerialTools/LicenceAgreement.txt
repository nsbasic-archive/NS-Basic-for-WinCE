Hi,

You find the ActiveX components SerialCE.dll and SerialXP.dll in the
SerialTools SDK. I guess you want to include them in some way in your own
download? Another option is that you simply forward your users to our site
for download, and they will get a fresh version in that case.

Those are the keys NSBasic developers should use:

SerialTools Standard ActiveX for Pocket PC:
sRYVMVfu32jo8XT1RNFZcUVtLV0v30NMsttx

SerialTools Standard ActiveX for Windows:
ISAjkPsNWjHYjFopdifGQcUMYRD5C9YOIwZ8

Let me know if you have any further questions.

I'll be happy to participate in any joint press release, and I can also post
the news on our site.

Best Regards,
Johan

 Hi,
 
 I can see that you have tried twice to place the order, but the credit
 card
 company (or shareit) rejected it both times.
 
 You can try again, or place the order over the phone:

   Payment can be by whatever method works well for you - which do
you
   prefer?
  
   Hi,
   
    This sounds reasonable. Is an update to SerialTools 2.0
standard
    expected any time soon?
   
   Not really. Only minor bug fixes as bug reports comes in.
   
    How will licence numbers work? Will there be a special one for
NS
  Basic
    users?
   
   Yes, there will be a license key for NS Basic users.
   
    Once we do this, let's also issue joint press releases and
create
  some
    publicity for both our products. :-)
   
   Absolutely
   
   Do we have a deal? In that case how do you want to pay?

    If someone wants extra support from you, they can always buy a
 copy.
  Of
    course, we will let them know about the professional edition
as
  well.

    Hi George,
    
    What about those terms:
    
    -Free distribution rights for SerialTools v2.0 Standard
 ActiveX
  for
    Pocket
    PC and Windows for NSBasic developers in NSBasic projects.
    -You may distribute SerialXP.dll and SerialCE.dll as part
of
 your
    NSBasic
    distribution.
    -Where you mention SerialTools on your site you also
mention
 it
  is
    owned
    by franson.com and you include a link to the SerialTools
 homepage.
    -NSBasic users are welcome to make posts about SerialTools
in
 our
    forum,
    but we will not necessarily answer any. If you are interested
in
    answering
    such posts you are welcome to do so.
    -You are not guaranteed technical support from us.
    -A one time USD 500 fee.
    
    Best Regards,
    Johan

     It's fixed! Thanks for your help in this.
    
     I'd like to find a way to distribute your tool with our
 product.
     Ideally, I'd like to pay about $500 for the right to
 distribute
  your
     desktop and Pocket PC tools to all our users. Only a few
 actually
   need
     serial comms, of course.
    
     I looked at the option of us simply being a reseller of the
  Franson
     Tools. This has the advantage of costing us no more than
the
  number
   of
     copies our customers actually use, but it would be easier
for
 us
  if
   we
     did not have to do the bookkeeping. For you, it's uncertain
 how
  many
     copies our customers might buy: perhaps getting $500 up
front
  might
   be
     worth more.
    
     Right now, we give our customers Microsoft's MSCEComm.dll
  control,
    which
     is free. Your control is better, since it does Bluetooth
well.
    
     Would this be possible?
    
     No good result yet.
     
     Other controls we've look at that use IPortEvents fall
back
 to
    IDispatch
     if IportEvents do not work, which is why they are OK for
us.
     
     We're still working on this...
