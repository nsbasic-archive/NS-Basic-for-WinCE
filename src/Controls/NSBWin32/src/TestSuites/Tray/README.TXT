Tray object examples - in NSBasic and VB

Both samples do the same. Note that for the sake of the sample 
simplicity the icon set is loaded from the current directory.
Thus if you start the examples from a programming environment you
may receive "failed to load image" at first. If this happens - 
check the settings for the program execution and make sure its
current directory is the directory containing the traysample.bmp.
