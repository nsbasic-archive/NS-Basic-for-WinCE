The bitmaps must be in the same directory with the EXE file.
For the ImgLoad.nsd example you need to know the resource ID-s
of the bitmaps/icons you want to load. For quick testing you can
browse to the system32\moricons.dll which contains over a hundred
icons with sequential resource ID-s (1,2,3 and so on).
