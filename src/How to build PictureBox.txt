How to create a PictureBox.ocx project

These are for eVC4. They work OK in eVC3 too. There are differences from the description below, but things pretty much work out OK if you ignore them.

1) Open EVC3

2) Choose New -> Project -> WCE MFC ActiveX Control Wizard

3) Choose Location... NSCEPictureBox (the folder containing evc4, desktop, src, and rsc).

4) Project name: NSCEPictureBox (yes, the same).  Leave all other settings as default.

5) Press OK, get dialogue "Step 1 of 2."  Change nothing; press Next ->

6) Get dialogue "Step 2 of 2."  Change threading model to "both."  Press Finish.

7) Should say something like "A class ID already exists in the registry.  Use existing class IDs for all 
classes?"  Press "yes."  Also dismiss the New Project Information box.

8) Exit EVC3.

9) Manually change the name of the NSCEPictureBox folder (the one inside the other NSCEPictureBox 
folder and parallel to evc4) to evc3.

10) Go into the evc3 folder and delete all files except

NSCEPictureBox.vcw
NSCEPictureBox.vcl
NSCEPictureBox.vcb
NSCEPictureBox.vcp

So, basically, keep NSCEPictureBox.vc*

It doesn't matter if you keep the subfolder for the Debug executable and stuff.

11) Start EVC3 again.

12) Open the new project workspace in the evc3 folder and go to the FileView in the project panel.

13) Delete all the files from the project panel.  Don't delete the folders, though.

14) Project->add to project->files

15) On the Insert Files Into Project, navigate to the src directory.

16) Change the file type to all files.

17) Add all the files (but not the folders).

18) Repeat 14-18 for the rsc directory, but this time add the first two files (i.e., don't add thumbs.db).

19) In the project panel, delete file_ver.cpp from the project.

20) In the project panel, delete gifTransparent.txt and all files after that, including the OC files.

21) Click on NSCEPictureBox Files in the project panel.

22) Choose Settings...

23) Click on the C/C++ tab.

24) From the list of options, remove the following:

/Fp"ARMV4Dbg/NSCEPictureBox.pch"
/Yu"stdafx.x"

Unless your fonts are weird, they should be on one line (scroll down a couple of lines in the text box.)

25) In the same panel, turn on "Not using Precompiled Headers".

Now it should work.  There's one warning that you may get about not being able to change the offset of 
an address.  Ignore it.
