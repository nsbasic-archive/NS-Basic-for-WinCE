And Inever thought of it.Please find gzip thingo complete source (formerly enterprise version), freeto give away.To your second question: I'm contracting to local businesses and there'sgenerally not enough time in a day to do it all. With the amount of supportand spec required by most people it's doubtful this would be a lucrativesource of income. So thanks - not at this moment.CheersWolf-----Original Message-----From: George Henne [mailto:gh@nsbasic.com] Sent: Monday, 2 August 2004 12:10 a.m.To: wolf kumpitschSubject: Re(2): Windows CE controlsWe list your controls on this page:<http://www.nsbasic.com/ce/info/controls/>One of our users wanted a zip control and I noticed the link didn't workanymore. If you would be willing to make the controls available on anunsupported basis, they can be added to our Big Red ToolBox, which has anumber of other controls that are similar.<http://www.nsbasic.com/ce/info/BigRedToolbox/>My second reason for asking is that from time to time, users want to pay toget special ActiveX controls written. We rarely have time to do this stuffourselves. Are you interested in doing that kind of thing?>Hi George,>Well... This didn't work out so well.
